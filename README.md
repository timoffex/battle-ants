# battle-ants (WIP)

This is a work-in-progress personal project. My goals are
- Learn how to design APIs in Haskell.
- Play around with exciting abstractions like monads and optics.
- Prove to a friend (and to myself) that you can write any program you could
  write in common OO languages in Haskell.
